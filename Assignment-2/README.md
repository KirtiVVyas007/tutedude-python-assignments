Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
Functionality
In this program, the user is asked to enter an integer number.
The program checks whether the entered number is even or odd using an if-else statement.
If the number is divisible by 2, the program prints that the number is even.
Otherwise, it prints that the number is odd.
This program helps in understanding the use of if-else conditions in Python.

Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop
Functionality
In this program, a for loop is used to iterate from 1 to 50.
Each number in this range is added to a variable to calculate the total sum.
After the loop finishes, the final sum of all numbers from 1 to 50 is displayed on the screen.
This program helps in understanding how loops are used in Python to repeat operations.
